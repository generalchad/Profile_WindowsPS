# PROTECTED PRINT QUEUES - by name
#
# Wildcard patterns matched with -like against the queue name. These are
# the "defaults" a technician's laptop is expected to have: the two
# Windows in-box virtual printers, whichever OneNote build is installed,
# the fax queue, and the Adobe writer (deliberately spared - older techs
# rely on it and its absence generates more complaints than the clutter
# it causes).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROTECTED PRINT QUEUES - by driver
#
# Name matching alone is not enough: a queue can be renamed ("PDF" or
# "Printer (1)") while still being the in-box Print to PDF, and deleting
# it leaves the machine without a virtual printer until the optional
# feature is toggled off and back on. The driver name never changes, so
# it is the reliable identifier.

# PROTECTED PORTS
#
# Monitors and pseudo-ports that belong to Windows itself or to the
# protected queues above. Deleting any of these either fails outright or
# breaks a queue that was meant to survive.
#
# LPT/COM are physical hardware ports enumerated by the OS, not spooler
# objects; they reappear on reboot but the deletion attempt logs a
# spurious failure, so they are excluded up front.
#
# IPP ports are deliberately NOT protected: they are created per device when a
# technician adds a Mopria/AirPrint copier, exactly like a Standard TCP/IP port,
# so an orphaned IPP port is the same site-clutter a TCP/IP port is and belongs
# in the sweep rather than beside FILE:/nul:.

# vendor monitor (Canon, Xerox, Kyocera bidirectional monitors) is left
# alone: those often carry configuration the vendor utility depends on,
# and their ports are recreated by the vendor software anyway.
#
# 'Standard TCP/IP Port' covers the ports created when a tech adds a
# device by IP - by far the dominant source of clutter. The IPP monitors cover
# Mopria/AirPrint copiers, which Windows adds through the IPP Class Driver
# rather than a raw TCP port.

# SCANNER / IMAGING DEVICES

# the cable is plugged back in, so removing them is pointless churn and
# they are skipped unless -Force is given.

# full copier install adds as software devices instead of WSD; those enumerate
# under SWD\WIA / ROOT\WIA and are every bit as stale as a WSD entry once the
# copier is gone. A USB device always enumerates under USB\..., so none of these
