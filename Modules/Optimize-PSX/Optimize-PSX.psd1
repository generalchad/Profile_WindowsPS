2.0.0
  - Refactored the monolithic .psm1 into Private\ and Public\ files with a
    thin loader, matching the layout used by the other modules here.
  - Conversions now run as a pool of concurrent chdman processes sized from
    a -CpuBudget percentage, with a separate -ThreadsPerJob dial for each
    process. -Sequential and -MaxConcurrency override the derived values.
  - Concurrency is reduced to one on rotational media, detected through the
    Storage provider. -IgnoreDiskType opts out.
  - The target tree is enumerated once into a reusable index instead of
    once per phase.
  - Conversion inputs are the disc sheets plus ISOs not described by a
    sheet, so each disc converts once and track files are never compressed
    on their own.
  - Cue and GDI sheets are parsed and validated during planning. Unresolved
    references are reported before any process starts.
  - Cue repair is opt-in via -RepairCueSheets, limited to unambiguous
    single-track sheets, takes a .bak first, and writes UTF-8 without BOM.
    Multi-track sheets are never modified.
  - Output is written to a temporary file and promoted only after chdman
    exits cleanly with a non-empty result.
  - Cleanup is driven by verified conversions rather than an extension
    sweep, and defaults to the Recycle Bin. -PermanentDelete opts out.
  - Added -Compression for an explicit codec chain, validated up front.
  - createdvd is selected for DVD-sized ISOs when the chdman build
    supports it.
  - Replaced -DeleteArchive/-DeleteImage with -RemoveArchives/-RemoveImages,
    -SkipArchive with -SkipExtraction, and the Verbose verbosity level with
    Detailed. Added -PassThru for a structured result object.

1.1.1
  - Previous single-file release.
